## Project Title

The Hidden Gaps Between Students’ Effort and Real Opportunities

## Executive Summary

This project applies Data Analysis and Business Intelligence techniques to explore the gap between students’ efforts and the real opportunities they access, such as internships, jobs, exchange programs, and scholarships. Despite significant effort in learning, applying, and self-development, many students fail to achieve proportional outcomes. Through survey-based data and descriptive analysis, the project identifies patterns of effort, awareness, and skill alignment, highlighting where and why opportunities are missed. The findings aim to support better decision-making for students, universities, and policymakers.
